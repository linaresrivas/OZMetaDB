# OZMetaDB — Meta Control Plane

OZMetaDB is a platform-agnostic Meta Database (Control Plane) that governs:
- Canonical naming conventions and standards
- Canonical data models (tables/fields/relations)
- Source system models (as-is) and mappings to canonical
- Job/pipeline generation specs (multi-platform)
- Field-level lineage (source → canonical → semantic)
- Metrics/KPIs definitions and compilation (SQL/DAX/Spark)
- Multi-cloud physical naming projections and failover roles
- A/B production slots (ProdA/ProdB)

## Key principle
Canonical definitions NEVER change for platform reasons.
Cloud/platform implementations are projections generated by adapters.

## Canonical coordinate naming
`{Client}-{Env}-{Platform}-{Domain}-{Region}`

Env values: `Dev, Test, Uat, ProdA, ProdB`

## Start here
- `docs/01-naming-conventions.md`
- `docs/02-environments-and-slots.md`
- `docs/03-multi-cloud-compatibility.md`
- `system-prompts/canonical-system-prompt.md`
- `metadb/logical-model/`

## Goals
- Visual deduction: names and logs are instantly interpretable
- Portability: Azure/GCP/AWS/OnPrem are all supported targets
- Integrity: auditability, lineage, and drift validation are first-class
