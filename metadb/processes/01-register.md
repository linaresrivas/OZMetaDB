# Process: Register

## Goal
Create/modify canonical and source definitions in MetaDB with governance.

## Steps
1) Register Platform and constraint/type profiles
2) Register Targets (Client/Env/Domain/Region) and TargetPlatform roles
3) Register canonical tables/fields/relations and 2-letter codes
4) Register source systems (as-is objects/fields)
5) Register mappings (MapObject/MapField/MapVersion)
6) Register jobs (Job/JobStep) and compilation targets (JobTarget)
7) Register metrics/KPIs and formulas

## Outputs
- A versioned, consistent definition set that can be compiled to physical targets.
